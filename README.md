## Environmental setup:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Infer

```sh
# Go to the corresponding example directory.
cd egs2/wsj0_2mix/enh1

# Data preparation and stats collection if necessary.
# NOTE: please fill the corresponding part of db.sh for data preparation.
# You need to download the WSJ0 dataset by yourself which may costs money.
./run.sh --stage 1 --stop_stage 5

# Inference. You can change the number of re like:for re in 3 6 8; do ... done for different M_re settings.
./infer_run.sh
```

## Training Code Release

The complete training code based on ESPnet-Enh will be released upon paper acceptance.
